# DailyMeetings
Few lines of HTML, JS, CSS (Bootstrap) that allows us to : creates a json-array with these two entries
```javascript
[
 {
      "length":900,
      "timestamp":"2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "workItemId":3648,
      "comment":"",
      "activityTypeId":"98923dd9-a6dc-4173-bb39-9b53e60593b7",
      "userId":"45913ed9-5bb3-41cc-b89f-af890bab2e33"
  },
  {
      "length":900,
      "timestamp":"2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "workItemId":2985,
      "comment":"",
      "activityTypeId":"98923dd9-a6dc-4173-bb39-9b53e60593b7",
      "userId":"45913ed9-5bb3-41cc-b89f-af890bab2e33"
    }
]
```
It createe entries in the array for each workday in the month (month as parameter). So these two records for each workday would give an array with approx. 40-44 records.
